Notes for our Android app in iteration 2:
- The phone must have Google Play Services installed for Google Maps to run.
- It is assumed that the phone is connected to a network. If not (e.g.: the phone is on airplane mode), there will be no pop-up windows to ask to download new data, i.e. no new data should be updated. The app will just use data from iteration 1 in this case.
